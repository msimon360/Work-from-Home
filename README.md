# Work-from-Home

# This project is to document everything I do to make working from home easier and more efficent.

Office setup:
Home office in the front of the house with a large window facing north.
Desk with a keyboard drawer.
Work PC (HP EliteBook) with docking station
Home PC (MacBook Pro)
acer 23" monitor
Logitech wireless keyboard / mouse
HBS-992 bluetooth headset
StarTech USB/Displayport KVM switch with audio
Set of desktop speakers
Cannon WiFi Printer MG3220

Desk
I bought the desk from Haverty's years ago. I mounted a basket to the bottom in the back to hold a power strip and all the adapters, chargers, axtra cable.
I would like to devise a way to lock the keyboard drawer partially open. For now I am using a doorstop.
I would also like to line the keyboard drawer. For now I use 2 mousepads.

Home PC (MacBook Pro)
I have power, mini-display port to display port cable, lightning to ehternet cable, USB cable, and audio cable plugged in. It would be nice to have a dock but they are too expensive.

Work PC (HP EliteBook)
Doc has power, ethernet, display port and audio cables.

KVM
This lets me switch the Display, Keyboard, Mouse, and desktop speakers between the Home and Work PCs. From the Work PC (Windows 10) I can use FN-PgDn to switch.
From the Home PC (Mac OS) I installed Trendnet switcher app and I can use Ctrl-1 to switch. There is also a button I mounted under the desk next to the keyboard drawwer
that will switch inputs.
